# About
It is important for software development teams to be aware of as much of the entire process of their project development as possible, in order to fully realise their own collective potential and address any shortcomings in their own team engagement or project’s technical quality as quickly and effectively as possible. A team lead or project manager would typically be the one most responsible for collecting and using the knowledge learned from their team’s ongoing project development. This is why it can be extremely useful when a given project’s team engagement and technical quality can be easily quantified and visualised in a meaningful and actionable way. Our collection of applications and extensions aim to do just that, by making use of the GitHub REST API, the Trello REST API, and the various utilities of Visual Studio.
