Trello Harvester

The Trello Harvestor tool is an easy to use tool designed to aid development team leads/managers in better understanding their teams performance based on the Trello board of a project. It requires users to have a Trello API Key, Token and the ID of their chosen board.

Getting your key and token:

- Login to your Trello Account.

-Go to https://trello.com/app-key and get your API key.

- On the same page, click on generate token to generate a token, this needs to be used to get authorisation for your board, lists and cards.

Getting your board ID:

There is unfortunately no intuitive way to do this. The best way to do this currently is to go to your Trello Board in the browser and add .json to the end of your boards URL. Then use CTRL + F (Windows) or COMMAND + F (Mac) and search for idBoard. 

These three pieces of data can now be used to interact with the Trello Harvester tool.
